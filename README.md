# Solar System Simulation

A 2d simulation of randomised solar systems, just as a way of learning to use canvas elements. Uses Newton's law of universal gravitation to generate a force of attraction on bodies, and a random noise function to generate background stars.

## Todo
- A way to add in new planet bodies to the solar system manually âœ“
- Include moons around the planets X 
- Have prebuilt solar systems, such as ours X 
- A mode to just mess around and play god, such as adding in multiple stars and seeing their orbits around each other X
