# Solar System Simulation

A 2d simulation of randomised solar systems, just as a way of learning to use canvas elements

## Todo
    - A way to add in new planet bodies to the solar system manually
    - Include moons around the planets
    - Have prebuilt solar systems, such as ours
    - A mode to just mess around and play god, such as adding in multiple stars and seeing their orbits around each other
